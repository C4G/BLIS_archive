Instructions for our new features,

- Free-text measure type can be applied in the same way as other measure types.
- The new visualization of patient reports are accessible from patient profile and specimen info pages  from the 'View Report Visualization' link on the left. The new updated version of Firefox is required to view these new reports. If you have not already updated your Firefox, the update for Firefox is available on our website, http://blis.cc.gatech.edu/download.php.
- The new specimen and test count reports are accessible from the reports page by choosing the 'Counts' option on your right. These new reports appear as 'Test Count (Grouped)' and 'Specimen Count (Grouped)' options. These reports are configurable from the lab configuration by choosing the 'Test/Specimen Grouped Reports' option under the 'Reports' option on the left.
